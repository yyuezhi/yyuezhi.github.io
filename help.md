## How to start locally
THIS is the version 0.13.0, you need to open docker desktop to run it
```
git checkout main
docker compose up
```
git commit -a -m ""
git push origin main:master

then use browser to login http://localhost:8080/

The img resource is in /asset, not in _site!
Do not use WSL and remeber to open docker destop
