I am a PhD student at University of Texas at Austin adviced by [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/). I was fortunate to work with [Dr. Hao Pan](https://haopan.github.io/) at Microsoft Research Asia and [Prof. Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping) at The University of Hong Kong during my undergraduate period.

I am interested in computer graphics, especially geometric modelling, 3D reconstruction and CAD model.

<!-- Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them. -->
