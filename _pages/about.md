I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Texas at Austin advised by [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/). I received my bachelor degree from Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong. During my undergraduate studies, I was advised by [Prof. Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping). Broadly, my research interests are in 3D vision, geometry processing, physical simulation and machine learning.
