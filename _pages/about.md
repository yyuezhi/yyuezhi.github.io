I am a PhD student in the Department of Computer Science at University of Texas at Austin adviced by [Prof. Qixing Huang](https://www.cs.utexas.edu/~huangqx/). I received my Bachelor degree from Department of Computer Science, The University of Hong Kong. During my undergraduate studies, I was advised by [Prof. Wenping Wang](https://www.cs.hku.hk/people/academic-staff/wenping). 

I am interested in computer graphics, especially geometric modelling and 3D generation.
